Provide 3 example based on Mustache(Hogan.js, Trimou), Handlebars.

Default example is using Hogan.js.

* [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io)
* [Mustache-Spring-View](https://github.com/Pitzcarraldo/mustache-spring-view)
* [Hogan.js](https://github.com/twitter/hogan.js)

And trimou branch is based on another Mustache java implementation [Trimou](http://trimou.org/).

Also you can compare with Handlerbars and Mustache in Spring MVC through handlebar branch.
